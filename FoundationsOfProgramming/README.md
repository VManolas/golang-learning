### Goals
- Maintainability
    - Simplicity
    - YAGNI (from XP)
    - Last Responsible Moment
    - DRY (*Object encapsulation and highly cohesive code can help us reduce duplication*)
    - Explicitness and Cohesion
    - Coupling
    - Unit Tests and Continuous Integration

### Domain Driven Design
*focuses on the problem domain as a whole, which not only includes the data, but also the behavior*. *So we not only focus on the fact that an `employee has a FirstName`, but also on the fact that he or she `can get a Raise`*.
- Users, Clients and Stakeholders
    - the ultimate measure of a system's success will likely be how users feel about it.
- The Domain Object
